in this project, our strategy is very simple. at the beginning part of game, we solve one puzzle and freeze our enemy.
then, we solve puzzle and get energy if our energy level is smaller than 600. Our strategy for collecting asteroids is similar with
the strategy in Lab 8: we collect the asteroid in the asteroid map, go in Y-direction first and then in X- direction.
During the process, if the energy goes below 600, we request and solve puzzle to get energy. during the process of waiting for puzzle
and solving it, our bot goes right to avoid to be dragged into the supernova. we go to a location which is on the station's path, and then
keep dropping the cargo until the cargo becomes zero, meaning that dropping succeeds. The cargo level is 60,that is, once the score we collect is over 60, we go dropping.
Then our bot repeat the actions above until the end of game.
